# Weather-cleaning-for-public-health-analysis
Two different data frames of rain and weather in Brazil. The objective is cleaning them and build a new one in order to analyse the correlation of dengue (serious disease transmited by mosquito), amount of rain and temperature.

The strategy used was to explicit in the pipeline the methods as much as possible, using clear functions for each step in the main code. The two DFs are treated and then a new one is built up, putting all relevant data together. This way the project can be analised with DS.
